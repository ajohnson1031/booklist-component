# Booklist Component

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### Deployment

You'll need two environment variables:

REACT_APP_GOOGLEBOOKS_API_KEY
REACT_APP_GOOGLEBOOKS_API_BASEURL

For the baseURL, you can use: https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes, but you'll have to create ea new API key @ the Books API site: https://developers.google.com/books/docs/v1/getting_started

That is all! Enjoy!
